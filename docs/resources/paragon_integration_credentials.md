# paragon_integration_credentials (Resource)

Manages credentials for an integration.

~> **IMPORTANT:** 
The credentials should be stored securely and not exposed in any public repositories.

-> **NOTE:** Currently only oauth creds are supported, Trying to update non-oauth creds will result in an error

-> **NOTE:** For regular non-custom integration, there's no way verifying what type of authentication they required, so there's no restriction updating them.

## Scopes in oauth app
Oauth integrations usually come with default scopes that if not supplied - might cause the integration not to work.
It's highly recommended to check them out (via UI -> Settings -> so you can set them as a resource, for example - the basic jira configurations look like this:
```terraform
resource "paragon_integration_credentials" "jira" {
  integration_id = "your_integration_id"
  project_id = "your_project_id"
  oauth = {
    client_id = "client_id"
    client_secret = "secret"
    scopes = ["offline_access", "read:jira-user"]
  }
}
```

## Example Usage

Use `paragon_integrations` data source to find out the relevant `integration_id`.

```terraform
# Create credentials for integrating a service
resource "paragon_integration_credentials" "example" {
  integration_id = "your_integration_id"
  project_id = "your_project_id"
  oauth = {
    client_id = "client_id"
    client_secret = "secret"
    scopes = ["scope1", "scope2"]
  }
}
```

```json
{
    "creds_provider": "jira",
    "id": "credentials_id",
    "integration_id": "your_integration_id",
    "oauth": {
      "client_id": "your_client_id",
